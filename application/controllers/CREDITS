This software is the work of many people, directly and indirectly. As someone brilliant and famous once said, "If I see far it is because I stand on the shoulders of giants".

Among the giants in my personal sphere of existence are, in no particular order:

All of the opensim devs since the beginning
Nebadon Izumi
Dave Coyle
Revoultion Smythe

and most especially, the customers of SimHost.com, who simply demanded this get done, and are making it financially feasable for me to focus on such things.
