This is a quick note about this software. More and better will follow,
this is simply here to quickly indicate a few key points.

1. This software is being made available in the spirit of the BSD
License.

2. This is open software, and we hope you will fork it and
adapt it to your needs.

3. Because of (2) above, we'd really like it too if you made pull
requests to incorporate generally useful improvements.

4. No Documentation yet, but we'll either obsolesce it with the
interface or provide it in proper form (eventually heh)

5. Dont let the (c) fool you, many people have already helped with
this either directly or indirectly, and all efforts will be recognized
in the credits.

Thanks for your interest!
